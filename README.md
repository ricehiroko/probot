If you've ever thought, "wouldn't it be cool if GitHub could…"; I'm going to stop you right there. Most features can actually be added via [GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/), which extend GitHub and can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks. Apps are first class actors within GitHub.

## How it works

**Probot is a framework for building [GitHub Apps](http://developer.github.com/apps) in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**,  written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). GitHub Apps can listen to webhook events sent by a repository or organization. Probot uses its internal event emitter to perform actions based on those events. A simple Probot App might look like this:

```js
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.on('issues.opened', async context => {
    const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Thanks for opening this issue!' })
    return context.github.issues.createComment(issueComment)
  })
}
```

## Building a Probot App

If you've landed in this GitHub repository and are looking to start building your own Probot App, look no further than [probot.github.io](https://probot.github.io/docs/)! The Probot website contains our extensive getting started documentation and will guide you through the set up process.

This repository hosts the code for the npm Probot package which is what all Probot Apps run on. Most folks who land in this repository are likely looking to get started [building their own app](https://probot.github.io/docs/).

## Contributing

Probot is built by people just like you! Most of the interesting things are built _with_ Probot, so consider starting by [writing a new app](https://probot.github.io/docs/) or improving one of the [existing ones](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aprobot-app&type=Repositories).

If you're interested in contributing to Probot itself, check out our [contributing docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Ideas

Have an idea for a cool new GitHub App (built with Probot)? That's great! If you want feedback, help, or just to share it with the world you can do so by [creating an issue in the `probot/ideas` repository](https://github.com/probot/ideas/issues/new)!
i forgot. so it's strange. Mrs Clinton did not say anything to a conglomerate, so the Clinton financial group of oneself said that there was no reason for killing me.
If this keeps going as it is, Article 9 amendment. Japanese politicians are making political contributions to Clinton financial group. Japan is shielded by Russia. and Japan force attack to north Korea under Princess Diana in heaven. Japan is a  facto military power country nationalism. For this reason Japan discards democracy. And we become border guards. The Abe 's Korean drama is already annoying to us which the system is already finished.  so we would be become an orphan of the world.
what a this story is! this is jet-black sunrise.this is rumor.
Aso and parliamentarians sent money to Clinton conglomerates with political contributions as  Akishinomiya will do emperor.  because the child of Princess Diana is convenient. Britain also has only the eldest son to bear the name of the royal family pretty strict with precepts. If I say it in Japan it is the prince of the eldest son. i don't understand Mr. Aso's plan. there is no difference in that Hironomiya is the eldest son of Michiko.  Aso is been so worring by hironomiya of International Convention decided. because Aso would considered that Japanese could goes to the north south?  
However, if you we force attack north, ballistic missiles will fly and abductee victims will have dead people. · We are meaningless north attack that we hope only to back to Japan all abductee victims.
it is been not a joke with Aso's rumor.this is rumor.
